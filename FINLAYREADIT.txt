2. Call QuestUtils.Generic.DecomposeDialogueLine on a string returned by a quest or QuestUtils.Generic.DecomposeDialogue on a list of dialogue to decompose it into a DialogueObject.

If dialogueObject.type == "Speech", then treat the dialogue as speech by putting the dialogueObject.text in the textbox, the dialogueObject.speaker (name) in the namebox and the dialogueObject.speakerImage (character image) in the character image box.
If dialogueObject.type == "Narration", then hide the namebox and character image box and put the dialogueObject.text in the textbox.
If dialogueObject.type == "Decision", then put each of the options in dialogueObject.options in the dialogue boxes, allowing the user to select the first obejct by passing 1 as the decision to accept, the second by passing 2 as the decision to accept and the third by calling reject().
